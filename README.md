# React + Vite To-Do List Application

This project is a simple yet powerful to-do list application built using React, HTML, and CSS. It leverages the minimal setup of Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and includes ESLint rules to ensure code quality.

## Features
- **Task Addition**: Users can add tasks to their to-do list.
- **Task Deletion**: Users can remove tasks from the list once completed or no longer needed.
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface built with React and styled with CSS.

## Technology Stack
- **React**: Utilizes React for efficient component-based architecture.
- **JSX**: Enhances the readability and maintainability of the code by using JSX.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic building blocks for structuring and styling the application.
- **Vite**: Employs Vite for fast development environment setup and efficient bundling.

## React Plugins Used
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) which uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) which uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
